Mount for Thordsen3D Inline Filament Dryer

Prints flat on back in loaded orientation. Installs similar to factory Voron 2.4 PTFE guide. 
Modeled to be centered with Voron 2.4 PTFE guide's hole to avoid strain in filament path. 
Part is 92mm long, keep in mind when installing, you may have to relocate your midspan panel retainers depending on your machine's size. 
Designed to be mounted on left side with spool holder on front left corner. Should work with other spool holder locations as well. 
Dryer's hot end sits into cradling arms utilizing the V6 heatsink's mounting collar.
